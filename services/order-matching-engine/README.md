# Order Matching Engine Microservice

The Order Matching Engine is a high-performance, lightweight microservice written in C++20 that implements a real-time order matching system for financial trading. It provides a gRPC-based API for submitting, managing, and querying orders across multiple financial instruments (symbols), with support for price-time priority matching and real-time trade streaming.

## Overview

This microservice serves as the core component of a trading system, responsible for:

- **Order Management**: Accepting buy/sell orders with price and quantity specifications
- **Matching Engine**: Automatically matching compatible buy and sell orders based on price-time priority
- **Order Book Maintenance**: Maintaining real-time order books for each symbol
- **Trade Execution**: Executing trades when matching conditions are met
- **Real-time Streaming**: Providing live trade updates via gRPC streaming

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **Multi-Symbol Support**: Handles orders for multiple financial instruments concurrently
- **Order Types**: Supports LIMIT orders with price-time priority matching
- **Order Operations**: Submit, cancel, and modify orders
- **Order Book Queries**: Real-time access to bid/ask levels
- **Trade Streaming**: Subscribe to live trade updates for specific symbols

### Technical Features

- **High Performance**: C++20 implementation with cache-friendly data structures
- **Thread Safety**: Per-symbol locking for concurrent access
- **gRPC API**: Efficient protobuf-based communication
- **Deterministic Replay**: Testing framework for reproducible order sequences
- **Micro-benchmarks**: Performance measurement using Google Benchmark
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment options

### Architecture

- **OrderBook**: Maintains bid/ask price levels with FIFO order queues
- **Matcher**: Triggers matching logic when orders are added
- **Trade Logging**: Persistent logging of executed trades
- **gRPC Service**: Handles client requests and streaming responses

## API Endpoints

### OrderService (gRPC)

- `SubmitOrder`: Submit a new buy/sell order

  - Parameters: symbol, side (BUY/SELL), type (LIMIT), price, quantity, client_id
  - Returns: order_id, status, message

- `GetOrderBook`: Retrieve current order book for a symbol

  - Parameters: symbol
  - Returns: bids and asks with price/quantity levels

- `CancelOrder`: Cancel an existing order

  - Parameters: order_id, client_id
  - Returns: status, message

- `ModifyOrder`: Modify price/quantity of an existing order

  - Parameters: order_id, new_price, new_quantity, client_id
  - Returns: status, message

- `SubscribeTrades`: Stream live trade updates for a symbol
  - Parameters: symbol
  - Returns: streaming TradeUpdate messages

## Data Structures

### Order

- `id`: Unique order identifier
- `is_buy`: Buy (true) or sell (false)
- `quantity`: Order quantity
- `price`: Price in ticks (integer representation)
- `timestamp`: Order submission time
- `client_id`: Client identifier
- `symbol`: Financial instrument symbol

### Order Book

- Bid levels: Buy orders sorted by price (descending)
- Ask levels: Sell orders sorted by price (ascending)
- Each price level contains a FIFO queue of orders

### Trade

- `buy_order_id`/`sell_order_id`: Matched order IDs
- `price`: Execution price
- `quantity`: Executed quantity
- `symbol`: Instrument symbol
- `timestamp`: Trade execution time

## Performance Characteristics

The service is designed for low-latency, high-throughput order processing with the following optimizations:

- **Integer Price Representation**: Prices stored as integers (ticks) to avoid floating-point precision issues
- **Cache-Friendly Layouts**: Data structures optimized for CPU cache efficiency
- **Per-Symbol Locking**: Fine-grained locking allows concurrent processing of different symbols
- **Efficient Matching**: Price-time priority algorithm with O(log N) complexity for order book operations

## Benchmark Metrics

The following benchmark results are from micro-benchmarks measuring the core order addition and matching operations. The benchmark simulates adding buy and sell orders at the same price and triggering the matching process.

### Benchmark Summary

| Metric  |       Value |
| ------- | ----------: |
| p50     | 0.512468 µs |
| p90     | 0.571549 µs |
| p99     | 0.593002 µs |
| p99.9   | 0.595148 µs |
| mean    | 0.523965 µs |
| samples |          10 |

| Time per iteration | 4.23 µs |
| CPU time per iteration | 4.22 µs |
| Iterations | 1,000 |

**Metric Descriptions:**

- **p50**: 50th percentile latency - median response time
- **p90**: 90th percentile latency - 90% of operations complete within this time
- **p99**: 99th percentile latency - 99% of operations complete within this time
- **p99.9**: 99.9th percentile latency - 99.9% of operations complete within this time
- **mean**: Average latency across all operations
- **samples**: Number of benchmark iterations

- **Operation**: Add order and trigger matching (BM_AddOrderAndMatch)
- **Iterations**: 1,000 benchmark iterations
- **Time per iteration**: 4.23 microseconds (average)
- **CPU time per iteration**: 4.22 microseconds (average)

**Context:**

- Host: `pop-os` Linux
- Date: `2025-03-25T08:21:45+03:00`
- CPUs: `8`

**Interpretation:**

- The metrics show excellent low latency (~0.5 microseconds) for order processing and matching
- With 10 samples, we now have proper statistical distribution showing realistic tail latencies
- The p99 latency of ~0.59 µs indicates that 99% of operations complete within 0.6 microseconds
- This demonstrates the high-performance nature of the C++ implementation with cache-friendly data structures
